# SwiftAssist AI Chatbot  

## Enhancing Customer Interactions with AI-Powered Conversations  

### Project Purpose  
SwiftAssist AI Chatbot is designed to deliver intelligent, human-like conversations by integrating intent recognition, sentiment analysis, dynamic response generation, and precise FAQ retrieval.  

The chatbot aims to:  
- Understand user intent and provide accurate responses  
- Analyze emotions to adjust response tone accordingly  
- Retrieve relevant FAQs using semantic search and cosine similarity  
- Generate dynamic, context-aware responses  
- Seamlessly deploy as an API for easy integration  

## Key Features and Technologies  

### Intent Recognition  
- **Model:** Fine-tuned BERT for classifying user intents  
- **Libraries:** Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch  

### Sentiment Analysis and Tone Adjustment  
- **Model:** Fine-tuned DistilBERT to detect emotions such as positive, negative, and neutral  
- **Tone Adaptation:** AI-generated responses adjust dynamically based on sentiment analysis  
- **Libraries:** Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch  

### FAQ Answering with Cosine Similarity  
- **Model:** SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic search  
- **Similarity Measure:** Cosine similarity ensures precise FAQ retrieval  
- **Libraries:** sentence-transformers, spaCy, scikit-learn, pandas  

### AI Response Generation  
- **Model:** Google Generative AI (gemini-1.5-pro-latest)  
- **Framework:** LangChain for dynamic and context-aware responses  

### Web Framework  
- **Backend:** Built using Flask for chatbot API deployment  
- **Libraries:** Flask, jsonify, render_template  

### Tools and Additional Libraries  
- **Python** for backend development  
- **Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn** for data handling and similarity calculations  
- **Joblib** for model serialization and loading  
- **Regex, SpellChecker, and spaCy** for text preprocessing  

## Key Achievements  
- ✅ Accurate intent recognition using fine-tuned BERT  
- ✅ Real-time sentiment analysis with DistilBERT and adaptive response tone  
- ✅ Efficient FAQ retrieval via SentenceTransformers and cosine similarity  
- ✅ Dynamic response generation using Google's Gemini AI  
- ✅ Seamless API deployment with Flask
